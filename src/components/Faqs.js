              Our boxes require a signature upon delivery – on the invoice delivered with your order. When placing your order, please be sure to leave any special delivery notes for the driver as to where you would like the package left in the Delivery Note section of the order form:</p>
                        <p>This space is helpful in letting the driver know you would like the box left behind a gate, at the back door, with a domestic worker, or even if your intercom is not working, etc.&nbsp;<br />
              Important information for business address:&nbsp; We recommend that you have the box delivered to your home address to avoid any shipping issues due to the office/business being closed for any reason.&nbsp; We do not have any information on when your business is open/closed etc. and are not able to account for this when shipping. Should your package be delivered to a business address when it isn’t open, we will endeavour to have your order delivered to you the following day.</p>
                        <p><br />
                            <strong>How will my order arrive? Is it frozen?</strong><br />
              Our meat is flash frozen at the peak of freshness and individually packaged and labelled.&nbsp; All of our boxes are packaged in a reusable and recyclable cardboard boxes. When retrieved on the guaranteed delivery date, your meat will be frozen or at a safe temperature for freezing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><br />
                            <strong>How many KGs come in a box?</strong><br />
              The weight varies depending on the selection of cuts received in that particular box. Each box contains approximately 5-6 kg of meat.</p>
                        <p><br />
                            <strong>Is delivery really free?</strong><br />
              Yes, delivery is really free. Always!</p>
                        <p>At the moment, we only deliver in and around Harare. We are actively looking into adding the ability to deliver to towns and cities outside of Harare. We hope to be able to offer delivery to these areas in the near future.</p>
                        <p><br />
                            <strong>When will my box arrive?</strong><br />
              We deliver Monday to Friday from 0900 until 1600.&nbsp; If your order is placed on Friday after 12pm,&nbsp;Saturday or Sunday you can expect the order to be delivered Tuesday. In order for us give&nbsp;our customers the best delivery service we have a 12pm cut off time , that means that all orders placed on a weekday&nbsp;after that stated time will only be delivered after 48 hours.<br />
              We do our best to deliver on weekdays only, but in the event there is a holiday when you place your order, or there is an unforeseen event that causes a delay, we will ensure you receive your order the following day.<br />

                        <p><strong>My order has been processed, can I still make changes?</strong><br />
              Once your order has been processed online and you have received your email notification, it is sent to our on-site butchery for preparation and delivery.&nbsp; If your order has been invoiced, we aren’t able to alter the delivery and the order cannot be cancelled as it is perishable.<br />
                            <br />
                            <em>IMPORTANT: </em>Please note in the event that the delivery address is altered once the order is in transit, we cannot alter this in the system. Due to the perishable nature of our product, we cannot guarantee the condition of the delivery if the address is incorrectly entered, if a change of address isn’t updated prior to the invoice date, if an address is altered while in transit, or if you are unable to receive the order on the pre-determined delivery date and did not notify us prior to the order being invoiced.</p>

              While we do our best to ensure weekday delivery, there are times when this isn’t possible such as with weekday holidays thus altering the scheduling delivery date.<br />
                            <br />
              We recommend that you have the box delivered to your home address to avoid any delivery issues due to the office/business being closed for any reason. When delivering to a business, our driver will not leave the package if no one is available or the business is closed, which can cause a delay in delivery.

              Once the order has processed for delivery, we are not able to make changes, recall or refund as we are shipping a perishable product with time sensitive delivery requirements that cannot be restocked or resold.</p>
